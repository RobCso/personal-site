    <h1>Welcome to my personal webpage</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>I have started my journey as a software developer and this is my first project page. On this page I will explore the world of coding and will try to implement all the knowledge that I've learned up until now. There is obviously an endless well of knowledge that I can tap into and as such I expect this website to improve as we go along my journey. I will try to make the website more interactive implement multimedia and more sections as well.</p>

    <p>I have struggled with mental health issues since my childhood and it definitely didn't get better. I've had to work hard and constantly fight to overcome and to live a productive life. I do have a lot of interests and photography is one of them. Although I have to push myself constantly into being active I really enjoy activity. I have prepared a small selection of my takes for you to have a look and if you liked any of it please leave a comment. </p>
